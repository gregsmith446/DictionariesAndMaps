This repo is an ASP.NET console app with code written in C#.

The code in Program.cs takes as input entries to a phonebook, 
which are added to a dictionary called Phonebook, which takes 2 strings.
After the entries are given via the command line,
the program also takes queries for the phonebook.

The output are the matches for the given queries or if there is no match, 
the string "not found."
